# Face-Recognition-Attendence

Face Check is a visitor management system that uses advanced technologies such as Python, OpenCV library, Flask and Supabase to provide a seamless visitor experience.

The system utilizes face recognition to identify repeat visitors, which eliminates the need for manual identification processes.
